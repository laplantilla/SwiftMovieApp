SwiftyMovieApp
===================

Simple MovieApp Built using Awesome [HanekeSwift](https://github.com/Haneke/HanekeSwift) , [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) &amp; [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON).
By no means this app is created by keeping best coding practices in mind. ( I am hardcore Android Dev :) and I created this app while experimenting with swift.)
